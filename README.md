# Pharmacokinetic Modeling MATLAB Script

## Overview

This MATLAB script simulates and analyzes a two-compartment and three-compartment pharmacokinetic model for a medication. The code also answers specific questions related to the models.

## Description

This MATLAB script provides simulations for pharmacokinetic models, including a two-compartment and a three-compartment model. These models are commonly used in pharmacology to describe the distribution and elimination of drugs in the body.

The script performs the following tasks:

1. Clears the MATLAB workspace and command window for a clean environment.
2. Initializes variables and parameters for the models.
3. Simulates drug concentration profiles over time.
4. Plots the drug concentration profiles for analysis.
5. Answers specific questions related to the effectiveness of the medication in each model.

## Usage

To run this MATLAB script, follow these steps:

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Copy and paste the entire script into a new MATLAB script file.
3. Save the script with a `.m` extension (e.g., `pharmacokinetic_model.m`).
4. Run the script in MATLAB.

The script will execute the simulations, generate plots, and provide answers to specific questions.

## Questions Addressed

The script answers the following questions:

1. **Question B (Two-Compartment Model)**: Determines when the medication is fully effective.
2. **Question C (Two-Compartment Model)**: Identifies the time when the medication is no longer effective.
3. **Question D (Two-Compartment Model)**: Specifies the time range during which the medication is effective.
4. **Question B (Three-Compartment Model)**: Identifies the time when the medication is effective in the three-compartment model.
5. **Question C (Three-Compartment Model)**: Calculates a specific value related to the effectiveness of the medication in the three-compartment model.
